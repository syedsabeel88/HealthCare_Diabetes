# Healthcare_Diabetes
## Overview:

* Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. 
* EDA
* Classification model like Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier,
Gradient Boosting Classifier, KNN Classifier are considered.
* Model evaluation for classification type is done by using confusion matrix, accuracy score.
* Modeling using Deep learning tensorflow using keras.
