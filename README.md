### DESCRIPTION
NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates
knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or
not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

### 1. Business Problem:
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how our body turns food into
energy. Having diabetes means your body either does not make enough insulin or cannot use
the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there is not enough insulin or cells stop
responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can
cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss and kidney disease.Hence this
is known as silent killer out of all diseases.There is no such medicine which can completely cure,
so it is adviced to take precaution to maintain normal glucose level in the body rather facing the
consequences later in life.
Early knowing of factors leading to diabetes play a vital role in predicting the disease. Based on
certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset and also by building a model to
accurately predict the patients diabetes will help patients to take necessary precaution before
suffering any further effect on health.
